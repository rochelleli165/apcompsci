4 this is a comment
4 below will print out apple: enter 5 for the print function, two spaces, and then what you want to print
4 the example below prints apple

5  apple

4 to print out a new line, do one space, an l
4 the example below prints a new line

5 l

4 you can also combine those two functions together
4 this prints cat and a new line

5 lcat

4 to do loops use the number 2,
4 followed right after the number of times you want to loop,
4 then what you want to loop
4 the example below loops println(yes) 4 times

24 5 lyes

4 math functions are simple
4 use the function 1, followed immediately by the first number, a space,
4 second number, a star, and three letters
4 add is +
4 act is -
4 ply is *
4 ide is /
4 mod is %
4 the examples below do 4+5, 4-5, 4*5, 4/5, 4%5 in that order

5 l14 5* add
5 l14 5* act
5 l14 5* ply
5 l14 5* ide
5 l14 5* mod

4 conditional statements start with 3
4 you can only compare ints 0-9
4 the format is int a + compare signs + / + int b + * + " " + inside function
4 the example below compares if 6 is equal to 6 (true),
4 which then prints "this is a conditional statement that works"

36==/6* 5 lthis is a conditional statement that works

4 inputs and variables are similar
4 use the number 0 and right afterwards the name of the variable
4 if you just initialize the variable, but give no value,
4 the user inputs the type and value
4 below is an example of an input called cat
4 to label it as a string, type s when asked for type
4 then for value type in the string value you want

0cat

4 you can also set it in code like this:
4 this is a string

0dog "hi"

4 this is for int

0shirt 3
