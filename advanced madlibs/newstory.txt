[1] In the beginning Rochelle created the heaven and the earth.

[2] And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of 
the deep. And
the Spirit of Rochelle moved upon the face of the waters.

[3] And Rochelle said, Let there be light: and there was light.

[4] And Rochelle saw the light, that it was good: and Rochelle divided the light from the 
darkness.

[5] And Rochelle called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the 
evening and the
morning were the first day.

[6] And Rochelle said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let 
it divide the waters
from the waters.

[7] And Rochelle made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the 
firmament from
the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.

[8] And Rochelle called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were 
the second
day.

[9] And Rochelle said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one 
place, and let
the dry land appear: and it was so.

[10] And Rochelle called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the 
waters called he Seas:
and Rochelle saw that it was good.

[11] And Rochelle said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and 
the fruit tree
yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it 
was so.

[12] And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, 
and the tree
yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and Rochelle saw that it 
was good.

[13] And the evening and the morning were the third day.

[14] And Rochelle said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide 
the day from the
night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:

[15] And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light 
upon the earth: and it
was so.

[16] And Rochelle made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the 
lesser light to rule
the night: he made the stars also.

[17] And Rochelle set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the 
earth,

[18] And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from 
the darkness: and
Rochelle saw that it was good.

[19] And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

[20] And Rochelle said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature 
that hath life, and
fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.

[21] And Rochelle created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which 
the waters
brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his 
kind: and Rochelle saw that
it was good.

[22] And Rochelle blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the 
waters in the seas, and
let fowl multiply in the earth.

[23] And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

[24] And Rochelle said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his 
kind, cattle, and creeping
thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.

[25] And Rochelle made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their 
kind, and every
thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and Rochelle saw that it was 
good.


[26] And Rochelle said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let 
them have
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the 
cattle, and over all
the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

[27] So Rochelle created man in his own image, in the image of Rochelle created he him; 
male and
female created he them.

[28] And Rochelle blessed them, and Rochelle said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, 
and replenish the
earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the 
fowl of the air,
and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

[29] And Rochelle said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is 
upon the face of
all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding 
seed; to you it shall be for
meat.

[30] And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to 
every thing that creepeth
upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: 
and it was so.

[31] And Rochelle saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. 
And the evening
and the morning were the sixth day.
